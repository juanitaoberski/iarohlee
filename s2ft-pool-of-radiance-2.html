I started playing DnD using one of the first modals produced (max level was 3 and I wish I saved, its probably a collectors item now), and have fond memories of games like Pool of Radiance. Playing BG and BG2 again, as well as NWN makes me long for a bygone day. I know there are some DnD clones out there, and many quite good, but learning new systems and magic systems, etc etc gets tedious. The DnD one I literally grew up with and would rather play. Anyone know whats up with the license. Все темы по игре Pool of Radiance.

Saw this sub just now. When I say "all the Goldbox games" I mean all the 9 games that were on the Wizworx CDROM collection that I bought ca 1995.

The PDF files that came with the games from GOG are great though for looking up maps (and cheating by looking things up in the cluebooks!). Рецензия на Pool of Radiance: Ruins of Myth Drannor.

So, I recently and happily left my corporate job to go work at a dispensary (I promise this is relevant), and my schedule will be pretty clear. If I need a weekly night off or whatever, I can most likely schedule that with zero issues. Because of this, I want to finally actually play DampD! I have one friend who kinda plays, and when he finds time he wants to start up a game - but he’s a newlywed who just got promoted, so I’m not gonna lay that expecta.

I've created a side mission for my players involving Tyranthraxus returning to Faerun. In our most recent game the party defeated the body he had possessed and he has fled back into the Pool of Radiance. From what I can understand, the pool is essentially liquid magic.
