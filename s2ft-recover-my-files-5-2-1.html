A few hours ago I saw a notification on my phone that it does not recognise the sd card that I have been using for years. I panicked straight away because it was holding every photo I have taken in my adult life. But I thought it would be ok because I was smart and had google photos synced, backing up all these photos. Turns out that if the photos on your phone disappear, then so do all the photos on google photos. They do not go into trash, they simply disappear.

TL;DR: Today I fucked up royally by "burning" the Solus linux distro over my 4TB archive disk – not with dd – but with the most user friendly GUI ever, Etcher (https://www.balena.io/etcher/). I need some advice before doing something potentially (even more) stupid! The moral of the story so far is to never leave any external disks plugged in while you write ISO's to USB drives!

I plugged it into the computer and all my files and folders were there, but when I clicked on one of them it was empty, and when I backed out of the folder the root was empty. I tried unplugging and plugging it in again, but now it was completely empty. Looked at the drive properties in Explorer and it says that 0 bytes are full, with 0 bytes free. In spite of this Windows says it's fine, even though I can't format it. Is there a way to fix this?

I am definitely an idiot for this, but I had my thesis on a jump drive that suddenly stopped working overnight.

Hey guys, I just wanted to get your opinions on what the best preventative care for a computer is. So far, my style has been using it until something breaks, and then floundering to fix it and recover my files (if it was a hard drive that went - as happened recently, spurring this question). Are there periodic things you'd all recommend people do on a regular basis, to catch these things sooner rather than later? For example: Should I run a HDD sector test once a month? Should I defrag every. Currently my PC had an issue in which it was running perfectly fine until i installed a 2017 redistributable package (Downloaded from official microsoft website). I restarted my PC and next thing I know, I get a system\_bad\_config\_info amp#x200B; Now i've been doing a lot of research and people have told me to do chkdsk (which i had done, didn't work), renamed the registries and copied it back to regback (Didn't work). Even ran Avasts' rescue disk because I thought I might have installed. So, I have an old hard drive and I wanted to recover my files from it but the Windows 10 Pro install on it is corrupted. It just tries to boot for like 5 minutes, asks if I want to do Disk Checking, I say no and then I get a CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED BSOD. The HDD is fine. When I boot from USB and select repair my computer reset and refresh don't show up as an option. So, is there a way to do a reset, since I know those backup keep your data. And also, I can't do startup repair. Today morning I tried booting up solus (I'm dual booting with Windows 10) , and it refused to boot, instead I got Generating "/run/initramfs/rdsosreport.txt" Entering emergency mode. Exit the shell to continue. Type "journalctl" to view system logs. You might want to save "/run/initramfs/rdsosreport.txt" to a USB stick or /boot after mounting them and attach it to a bug report. I don't know what to do, and I wanted to know if there is any way I can recover my files, so I may do a clean insta.

Suddenly it wasn't an issue to change my name. The hr rep was utterly unprofessional through the whole thing and dead named me 3 times in the email chain but in the end I got my computer records updated! Currently my legal name is still my deadname, however I have come out to the people I work with and everyone has been understanding. When I first came out I first emailed the HR rep and a short while. I just lost a minute of animation! I finished it, and was exporting when Adobe crashed and now it says theres an error opening the fla file. It was autosaving the whole time, but now none of my copies will open. Is there any way to recover I accidentally formatted an external hard drive of mine that has a lot of files on it. It has photos, videos, audio files, etc. I used a software called Jihosoft to recover my files, but a lot of my files (mostly the photos) are blank and/or no longer recoverable. I also noticed that when I recovered the files, I didn't know what they were (apart from what file type they were) even when I checked their properties. I have also come to realise that because my video files and audio files are separ.
